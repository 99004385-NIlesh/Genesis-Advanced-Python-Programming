# Genesis-Advanced-Python-Programming-Mini-Project #

## Introduction ##

For this project,we are provided an excel file containing 5 different sheets having the following data:-

* Basic Details
* Cities Travelled
* Test Marks
* Hobbies
* Expertise

All these 5 sheets have a primary data ie. "PS Number" 

Now,our job is to access that file using "user-defined function".For this,we need to show the list of all the PS Numbers to the user and then ask him for the input.
Based on the correct PS Number entered by the user,we need to output the requested data in a new excel file.

Also,if user enters wrong details,we need to handle that with Exception Handling.

## Implementation ##

The following modules are created for this:-

* main => Main File of the Project 
* active_excel => Opens the Excel File and makes it active
* print_psnumber => Prints all the PS Numbers present in the Excel File
* print_sheets =>
